## About Me

Hello! I'm Di Zhu, a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. I'm a member of the Network Mechanics Group (NMG), where I'm fortunately working with Professor [Hyojoon Kim](https://hyojoonkim.com/). 

Before joining UVA, I worked as a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the College of William & Mary for two years. I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science degree at Boston University and my B.Eng. in Computer Science degree at Sichuan University, China.

My research focuses on In-Network Computing (INC), with a focus on developing systems to enable fast, low-latency and energy-saving in-network applications in modern datacenter networks.
